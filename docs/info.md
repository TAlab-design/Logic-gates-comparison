## How it works|

This circuit needs to accept 4 different two two-bit values, A and B. It needs to output 4 different one-bit values, for each gate AND, NAND, XOR and XNOR.

## How to test|

Simulate using Wokwi, testing against the truth table as a golden file

## External hardware|

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
